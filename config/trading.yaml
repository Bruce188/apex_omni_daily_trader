# ApexOmni Trading Bot Configuration
# ===================================
#
# This file contains trading parameters and safety settings.
# API credentials should NEVER be stored here - use .env file instead.

# API Configuration
# -----------------
# Credentials are loaded from environment variables (.env file)
api:
  # Network endpoint: "mainnet" or "testnet"
  # ALWAYS use testnet for testing before going to mainnet!
  endpoint: "mainnet"

# Trading Configuration
# ---------------------
# NOTE: Leverage is ALWAYS 1x (hardcoded for safety)
# NOTE: Positions are ALWAYS closed immediately (hardcoded for safety)
# NOTE: Symbol is ALWAYS auto-selected (cheapest tradeable symbol)
trading:
  # SYMBOL SELECTION: AUTOMATIC
  # ---------------------------
  # The bot ALWAYS selects the cheapest tradeable symbol based on your balance.
  # There is no "preferred" symbol concept - this minimizes trading costs.
  # The 'symbol' field below is DEPRECATED and ignored.
  # symbol: "BTC-USDT"  # DEPRECATED - ignored, bot auto-selects cheapest

  # Default trade direction: "BUY" or "SELL"
  side: "BUY"

  # Order type: "MARKET" or "LIMIT"
  # MARKET recommended for guaranteed fills
  type: "MARKET"

  # Trade size in base currency
  # NOTE: This is overridden by the auto-selected symbol's minimum order size
  size: 0.001

  # Minimum trade value target in USDT
  # Bot will look for symbols where min_order_size * price >= this value
  min_trade_value_usdt: 1.0

# Safety Configuration
# --------------------
safety:
  # Dry-run mode: simulate trades without execution
  # ALWAYS start with dry_run: true until you've verified everything works!

  # Maximum position size allowed (in base currency)
  max_position_size: 0.01

  # Maximum trades per day (safety limit)
  # Increased for continuous mode
  max_daily_trades: 10

  trade_interval_hours: 4

  # Days to trade: 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ..., 4=Friday, 5=Saturday, 6=Sunday
